## A Blueprint for the Post-Ego Republic
**December 2025**
**Primary Architect: Jason Steed**
(With simulation and red-teaming assistance from Grok (xAI) and Gemini 3 (Google))

### The Problem
America is bankrupt, captured, and ruled by career politicians who serve donors, not citizens.
The current system rewards narcissism, punishes competence, and mathematically guarantees debt slavery.

### The Solution: System v3.1-F
A complete constitutional operating system that removes ego, greed, and leeches by design.

#### Core Components
1. The Drafted House — 435 random citizens selected by lot every 2 years (like jury duty). No campaigns, no donors.
2. The Merit Senate — Only former Drafted House members, elected by peers. Max 12 years.
3. The Anonymous Executive Council — 6 citizens (3 elders + 3 experts). No names, no faces, no cults.
4. The Debt Tithe — 10 % of all federal revenue automatically pays down principal before any spending.
5. Family Capital Account — $4,000–$6,000 per citizen child per year, locked until age 18.
6. Real-Time Global Voting — Every American can veto any bill at drafted-house.vercel.app
7. Judicial Ladder & Accountability — Judges climb district → appellate → high court. Fired for legislating from the bench.

#### Amendment XXVIII – Exact Legal Text
Section 1. Sortition and the Drafted House
The House of Representatives shall consist of four hundred thirty-five Citizens selected biennially by lot from among all adult citizens of the several States...

[Full 1,147-word Amendment XXVIII text — ready for Article V]

#### Transition Strategy: The Viral Host
1. Live app already running
2. Seed 1,000+ local shadow councils
3. When 34 states demand it → Article V convention → ratify Amendment XXVIII
Congress cannot stop it.

#### Current Status
- Live voting app: https://drafted-house-your-url.vercel.app
- Real-time one-vote-per-IP counter
- Full amendment text: this page
- First shadow councils forming now

This is not left. This is not right.
This is math.

The republic you were promised is now open-source.
