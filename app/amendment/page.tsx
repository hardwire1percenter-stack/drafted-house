## "Competence Over Charisma"

### I. The Eligibility Protocols (The "Stability" Filter)
Participation in governance is a duty, but it requires proven stability. The "lottery" for the Draft is not random; it is drawn from a qualified pool of "Stable Citizens."

#### A. The Universal Competence Filter
To enter the Draft Pool or receive a Nomination, a citizen must meet ONE of the following Educational or Labor benchmarks to prove consistency and commitment:
1.  **Education:** Minimum Associate Degree (Any Field).
2.  **Labor Alternative:** * High School Diploma PLUS
    * 4 Years continuous employment at a single employer, OR
    * 6 Years consecutive employment across maximum two employers.

#### B. Age & Tenure Brackets
* **The Drafted House (Legislative):**
    * **Term Length:** 4 Years (Single Term).
    * **Minimum Age:** 21
    * **Maximum Age:** 55
    * *Focus:* The active workforce; those currently building the nation.

* **The Senate (Oversight/Judicial Tie-Breaker):**
    * **Minimum Age:** 25 (Calculated: House Term [4] + 21)
    * **Maximum Age:** 65
    * *Focus:* Senior oversight; experience tempering action.

* **The Administrative Council (Executive):**
    * **Minimum Age:** 25 (Matches Senate Minimum)
    * **Maximum Age:** NO LIMIT
    * **Requirements:** Same Education/Labor stability filters as House/Senate.
    * *Focus:* Wisdom and long-term stewardship.

### II. The Drafted House (Legislative Mechanics)
* **Selection:** Members are drafted by lottery from the "Qualified Pool" (see Section I).
* **Mandate:** Serving a single 4-year term. Removes campaign finance, lobbying, and reelection incentives.
* **Function:** Proposes and debates legislation based on real-world needs, not donor requests.

### III. The Judiciary (Appointment & Tenure)
1.  **Nomination:** The Administrative Council nominates a slate.
2.  **The Red Council Vetting:** Nominees are vetted by AI strictly for constitutional qualifications.
3.  **The System Vote:** The System tallies objective metrics to select the jurist.
4.  **Tie-Breakers:** In the rare event of a metric tie, The Senate casts the deciding vote.

### IV. Operational Mechanics
* **The Pension System:** Service guarantees a life pension, removing the need for post-office lobbying jobs.
* **Term Limits:** Absolute limits enforced on all positions.
* **Graduated Capability:** Access to Council nominations is gated. One must prove competency at municipal levels before federal eligibility.

### V. The 4th Branch: The Citizen Veto
* **Direct Check:** Every citizen holds a digital key.
* **Power:** Citizens retain the absolute power to VETO any act of the Drafted House via the app.
* **Threshold:** If a bill hits a Veto threshold (e.g., 60%), it is immediately nullified.

### VI. The Cultural Engine (The "F" Patch)
1.  **The Builder's Metric:** Social influence is tied to the **Graduated Capability** scale. Builders (Tier 2+) are amplified; performative outrage is deprecated.
2.  **The Horizon Mandate:** To prevent stagnation, 15% of GDP is constitutionally mandated toward a "Frontier Goal" (e.g., Fusion, Space) every 20 years.

### VII. The Transition Strategy: "The Viral Host"
Revolution is obsolete. System v3.1 out-performs the old system until the old system becomes irrelevant.
1.  **Incubation:** Deploy the "Shadow System" in failing rust-belt municipalities.
2.  **Competence Gap:** Citizens see the App solving problems faster than City Hall.
3.  **Host Integration:** The legacy government is forced to adopt v3.1 tools to survive, effectively rewriting its own DNA.

**Appendix C – 120-year simulation results:**
* **Survival Rate:** 96%
* **Corruption Index:** Near Zero
* **Stagnation Index:** 12%`}
